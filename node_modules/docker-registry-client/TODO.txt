- test case for docker hub v1 private repo pull
- v2 push support (complete the v2 api)
- examples/listTags.js (or whatever name) to show how to key of v1 or v2
  automatically determined.
- switch to restify-clients (not until my http-proxy improvements are in tho!)
- pagination for v2 API endpoints that support that (e.g.
  https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#listing-repositories)
- better error wrapping from reg errors. E.g.a 404 (say for
  `v2/getManifest.js alpine:nosuchtag` returns:

        { [NotFoundError: {"errors":[{"code":"MANIFEST_UNKNOWN","message":"manifest
           unknown","detail":"unknown manifest name=library/busybox tag=unknowntag"}]}
        body: { errors:
             [ { code: 'MANIFEST_UNKNOWN',
                    message: 'manifest unknown',
                           detail: 'unknown manifest name=library/busybox
                           tag=unknowntag' } ] }

  Whitelisted improved wrapping?
  There is no restCode here for example. Clients having to key on the
  statusCode sucks.
- Docker-Content-Digest: are there tarsum.v1+sha256:... ones out there to
  worry about?
- would be nice to have an example that showed how to reliably impl 'docker pull'
  from either v2 or v1 (e.g. as in the imgapi impl).
